#Tanks

About
-----

This game, which I programmed during the summer (2014) after my junior year
in high school, is a game in which the player controls a tank and battles
enemy tanks to advance. It has totally illogical physics.

I programmed it with C++ and SFML 2.1.

I borrowed some of the original versions of the files from the source code
of the book "SFML Game Development" by Artur Moreira, Henrik Vogelius
Hansson, and Jan Haller.

The following YouTube video contains a demonstration:

Features
--------

This game includes tanks that can move and rotate, artificial intelligence,
collision detection, various enemies with different characteristics, data
for levels and tanks that is read from text files, and a state stack to
handle menus.

How to Run
----------

Download the project (perhaps from the releases section), unzip the folder,
open Tanks.sln with Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Express (also known as
VS Express for Desktop), and run it (i.e. click "start debugging"). Note
that the SFML files, data text files, and media files are in the
repository.

Releases
--------

The most recent release is: v0.2

Check the releases tab of this repository on GitHub for the most recent
version.

Known Problems
--------------

Should you happen to make your own edits, understand that having too
many enemies (and thus, too many bullets) causes the framerate to suffer
noticeably.
