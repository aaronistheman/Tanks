<p>These webpages were designed and programmed by me. I made them to gain
 some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this process, I also
 gained experience with the jQuery library and with jQuery AJAX. Furthermore,
 I looked into languages such as PHP and Bootstrap, although I did not use
 them in these webpages. Of course, I could not have done it without 
 W3Schools, whose tutorials I used to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>The game Tanks was also programmed by me. I made it to gain a greater
 grasp of object-oriented programming, C++, and the SFML library. The book
 <i>SFML Game Development</i> by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, and 
 Artur Moreira helped me greatly by providing me with a way to approach
 game development.</p>

<p>For what it is worth, my name is Aaron Singh.</p>
